        "The Human Development Index (HDI) provides a broad, intuitive measure for comparing overall human progress across countries and over time. A higher HDI implies longer, healthier lives, better education and higher command over resources; however, it does not capture inequality, sustainability or subjective wellbeing",
        "It is a composite summary of a country's average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development – health (life expectancy), knowledge (schooling) and material wellbeing (GNI per capita) – combined through a geometric mean into a single 0‑to‑1 score.",
        "Each dimension of the HDI is captured by a specific index:\n  - **Healthy life**: Captured by the _Life Expectancy Index_, which is based on life expectancy at birth.\n  - **Good education (knowledge)**: Captured by _Education Index_, which is based on the expected and mean years of schooling.\n  - **Decent standard of living**: Captured by _Gross National Income (GNI) Index_, which is based on the GNI per capita (PPP$).",
        "The index is estimated by normalizing and aggregating the above indicators. First, the indicators are brought onto the same scale, ranging from 0 to 1. This is done by setting minimum and maximum values for each indicator. The minimum and maximum values for each indicator are defined as follows:\n  - Life expectancy at birth ranges between 20 and 85 years\n  - Expected years of schooling between 0 and 18 years; Mean years of schooling, between 0 and 15 years\n  - GNI per capita between 100 and 75,000 international-$ at 2021 prices.",
        "The HDI is then estimated as the geometric mean of these indices. The education index is the arithmetic mean (average) of the mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling."
